# daylight - WIP

2D adventure game made with SDL2 and Opengl and any feedback, fixes or optimizations are appreciated.

currently using basic implementation of deferred PBR and physical bloom and the game will be 2D with 3D objects and advanced lighting techniques.

The "engine" itself is still part of the main project yet this will most likely change and i will make it a library.

My goal is to make a game that runs on a stable 60 fps on the steam deck while making it look good.
